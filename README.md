# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction Web App

## 📌 Project Overview

This project predicts whether a passenger would **survive the Titanic disaster** using **Machine Learning (Logistic Regression)**.
The model is trained on the famous Titanic dataset and deployed as an **interactive Streamlit web application** for real-time predictions.
